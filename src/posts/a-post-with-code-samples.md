Quarantine is that time *we* have always used as an excuse to not achieve our set goals, and like an answered prayer, we have it now, so it is best we put it to good use and make it count.

Today, i want to share a few thing i have been doing with boo which i think will be of benefit to us during and after the quarantine period. So we go back to work, school and our normal daily activity after the lock down, as a positively changed person.

*Most importantly, as individuals, we can not fully achieve something until we have set our minds to it, so put your mind to it, and get it done.*

So let's get right to it. here are 10 things that will help you make quarantine productive and very interesting.

### **MEDITATE.**

Meditation is that moment of silence. This time is not to reflect on the past, but to time to focus on the now and ease yourself off the stress that has accumulated. it is a moment to observe just what matters at the time- the mind. This act goes a long way in helping us purge off all negativity, and helps focus on the better picture. This is  effective when you stay still and just remain silent. while focusing on the inner self- the mind and heartbeat. This act increases calmness and peace. And it further helps us become conscious of every little details and keeps us very vibrant and active.

### **DAILY SPIRITUAL WORKOUT**

Starting our day with God in view makes it a little more better. While at home during quarantine, it is also necessary that we work on our spiritual growth. Bible study, worship session, listening to messages and an intense prayers session everyday is key to making us grow spiritually. This further helps us build an intimate relationship with God and stay focused on our goal.

### **HAVE A DAILY TO-DO LIST**

This is another very essential thing to do during this period. Setting daily plans and reminder helps us keep tracks of things to do and achieve before the end of the day, it also helps us look through it at the end of the day to ensure we truly have been productive during the day. this is effective when it is written down especially in a daily to do list. This helps us stay focused while staying at home

### **READ MOTIVATIONAL BOOKS**

One thing i never forget to do everyday during this period is read. And as much as some people find this a not so interesting thing to do, i still think it is important to help us grow. reading books helps in strengthening the brain, improves the theory of mind, and helps us increase knowledge. Here is a little trick for people finding it extremely hard to finish a book, pick a theme to read on and at least two to three books on that particular theme, *for instance, your theme is how to build self esteem, you can go with the power of positive thinking by Norman Vincent Peale, OR Awaken the Giant within by Tony Robbins* when ou have your books ready, start with one, and set a deadline for yourself. You can go with five pages per day or one chapter per day. Just put your mind to it. This helps us read more and helps the book have a lasting impact in us.

### **TAKE PROFESSIONAL COURSES**

This period is the perfect time to grooming yourself. So, it is vital that you try to learn a skill or improve if you have one. More so, professional websites are giving back during this period, and they are offering professional courses for free, so you can take advantage of it. Take a course you have interest and keep at it. All you need is data connection and dedication. Here is a list of website offering free courses to help:

### **CHECK UP ON FRIENDS**

As much as this lock down has it positive sides it also has its negative side on people, especially for those struggling mentally and financially. I have personally been taking this period to reach out to old folks, and this has helped a lot, especially during your free times in the day. That call you want to make, can help somebody smile, and help them know that you care. More so, it  can further helps to strengthen or build that bond you you with loved ones, family and friends. So make that call, now!  

### **UPDATE YOUR LINKEDlN PROFILE**

For professional folks, Linkedln is a great place to help us network and build professional connection with potential client and employees, and it has always been about our normal life before the lock down. This period is a perfect opportunity to  build your professional profile,  and post interesting stuff on your profile. it further helps you in attracting people which could be a great boost to your career.

### **HAVE A DAILY WORKOUT ROUTINE**

Quarantine has made a lot of people of discover that hidden-eating talent, i am a valid example. LOL. staying at home with a lot to eat has its bad side (we definitely did the lock down shopping)and can make one forget fit-fam, but keeping fit is still a great business, trust me. So during this period, it is ideal to have a daily work out routine, start with a morning run, then a work out session maybe in the morning or evening, whatever works for you. we all need to get out of quarantine period with that smashing body.

### **TRY A NEW RECIPE**

Cooking is one interesting and fun thing to do (for some people). Personally, cooking is a very exciting thing to do, which is why i think quarantine can help us try out new stuff in the kitchen. try making a new dish, bake, or even do a switch up on your normal food-making technique. This will be fun, trust me. Just enjoy it.

### **DO SOMETHING INTERESTING**

Get that hidden talent out! you have time now. learn karaoke, color your room, make a dress, dye your hair, do yoga.. Just do something really exiting, please. Make quarantine worth it and be fulfilled at it. Just enjoy that moment, and do the first crazy thing that comes to your mind. it's not cliche, it's just a switch up, duh.
