hey there, welcome to my page. this can officially count as my first post, as i will like to discuss a few thing that i and a very close friend of mine has been doing to make positive changes in our lives, and work on ourselves too.

quarantine is that \*time\* you have always used as an excuse to not achieve your set goals, and like an answered prayer, you have the time now, make a great use of it.

today, i will be discussing on fifteen essential things that you should get done during this quarantine period. you might not necessarily get all of the fifteen done, but trust me, you need to do at least ten of these so as to keep sanity and go back to work,school or your normal daily activity after the lock down a positively changed person.
