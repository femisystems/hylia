Hey there, welcome to my page. This can officially count as my debut post, and i promise a great one. Today, i will like to discuss a few thing which could be beneficial to us during this "*lock down".* So, i and a very close friend of mine has been doing some real restructuring for ourselves, trying to make this period count and i felt it was necessary to share them, i hope you find this very useful. in the context of this post  i will be discussing fifteen essential things to get done during this quarantine period. importantly, you might not necessarily get all of these fifteen done, but trust me, you need to do at least ten to make this worth it, and to keep sanity. at least, so we can go back to work, school or our normal daily activity after the lock down a positively changed person.

Quarantine is that *time* you have always used as an excuse to not achieve your set goals. oh well, like an answered prayer, you have it now, and it is best make great use of it and make this count.

importantly, as an individual, we can not fully achieve something until we have set our minds to it, and so i would like us before reading this to just say these words of confirmation;

"yes, i'm doing this"

"yes, i will achieve this"

"yes, i will make this progress"

"yes, will change positively".

saying these words with actions will make us fully take charge of the present situation, and make great use of it.  And so i have outlined specific things that we have been getting done, and i know you would love it too, join me. 

**1. MEDITATION.**

Meditation is that moment you just sit still and observe. this time is not to reflect on your past, its a time to focus on the now and ease yourself off that stress that has . its that time of silence where you just let everything go and observe everything that matters at this time- the now. this act goes a long way in helping our daily activities, as it helps on only to be focused and placed on the thing that truly matters in our life which is *now.* meditation is best done and effective when you sit still and observe everything- your mind, your heartbeat, your sense of smell. this single act increases calmness, and peace.

meditation is one thing that is helping me become conscious of every little details,  and happening and it keeps us very vibrant and active. trust me, you want to do this as it helps us purge every unnecessary feeling we hold. everyday, just take at least 5 mins, preferably very early in the morning before any other activity, trust me this works.

**2. DEVOTION**

Personally, growing up in an African-christian home, we- my family, usually observe a devotion time everyday, but i realized that this does not really count if i really want to have an intimate moment with God, and so i tried observing my own daily devotion in this order- wake up read my bible, sing worships, and say my prayer. This has helped me become closer to God and has  made me intimate with him. i think it has also helped my journey with him, and has helped make this quarantine a great one.

It is an awesome try, trust me, and i think it is one of the most important thing to help us through this quarantine period.

**3. SET DAILY PLANS**

One very thing that will help us stay focused is keeping tracks of things to do and achieve before a particular time frame. for instance if you have an issue with finishing a book you can start with challenging yourself to finish five pages per day, or one chapter in a day, this helps you stay focused
