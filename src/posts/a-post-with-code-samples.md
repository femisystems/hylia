Hey there, welcome to my page. This can officially count as my debut post, and i promise a great one. Today, i will like to discuss a few thing which could be beneficial to us during this "*lock down".* So, i and a very close friend of mine has been doing some real restructuring for ourselves, trying to make this period count and i felt it was necessary to share them, i hope you find this very useful. in the context of this post  i will be discussing fifteen essential things to get done during this quarantine period. importantly, you might not necessarily get all of these fifteen done, but trust me, you need to do at least ten to make this worth it, and to keep sanity. at least, so we can go back to work, school or our normal daily activity after the lock down a positively changed person.

Quarantine is that *time* you have always used as an excuse to not achieve your set goals. oh well, like an answered prayer, you have it now, and it is best make great use of it and make this count.

importantly, as an individual, we can not fully achieve something until we have set our minds to it, and so i would like us before reading this to just say these words of confirmation;

"yes, i'm doing this"

"yes, i will achieve this"

"yes, i will make this progress"

"yes, will change positively".

saying these words with actions will make us fully take charge of the present situation, and make great use of it.  And so i have outlined specific things that we have been getting done, and i know you would love it too, join me. 

**1. MEDITATION.**
