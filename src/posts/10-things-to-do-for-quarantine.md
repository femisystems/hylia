Quarantine is that time we have always used as an excuse to not achieve our set goals, and like an answered prayer, we have it now, so it is best we put it to good use and make it count.

Today, i will like to share  few thing i have been doing since the start of the 'lock down' which i believe will be of great benefit to you during and after the quarantine period- at least So we go back to work, school and our normal daily activity after the lock down, it will as a positively changed person.

Most importantly, as individuals we can not fully achieve something until we have set our *minds* to it, so put your mind to this and get it done to achieve a positive result.

So let's get right to it. Here are 10 things that will help you make quarantine productive.

   **MEDITATION.**

Meditation is that moment of silence and calmness. This time is not to reflect on the past, but a time to focus on the now and ease yourself off the stress that has accumulated into the body. It is a moment to observe just what matters at the time- the mind and the aliveness of the body. This act goes a long way to help one purge off all negativity, and helps focus on the better picture.  This is  effective when you stay still and just remain silent, while focusing on the inner self- the mind and heartbeat. This act increases calmness and peace. More so, it helps us become conscious of every little details and keeps us very vibrant and active. For effectiveness, They are quite a number of application that helps with this. Personally, i use lets meditate, and it is the absolute best, if you need it, you can download here it here- 

   **DAILY SPIRITUAL WORKOUT**

Starting your day with God in view makes it better, i mean it just gives me this reassurance. Since you are home, it is very important that you work on your spiritual growth, and intimacy with God.  Bible study, worship session, listening to messages and having an intense prayer session everyday is key to making us grow spiritually. This further helps us build an intimate relationship with God and stay focused on our goal.  

   **HAVE A DAILY TO-DO LIST**

Having a plan for the day helps us keep a productive day, as it helps us keep track of things to do and achieve before the end of the day, we can also look through it at the end of the day to ensure we have kept to it. This is effective when it is written down especially in a daily to do list. This helps us stay focused while staying at home

   **READ BOOKS**

One thing we should not forget at this free time is to read at least a book, as reading helps us increase strengthen the brain, expands our vocabulary, improves the theory of the mind, it helps improves focus and concentration and helps increase knowledge- this and many more we would miss when we let ourselves become too lazy to read. Yes, reading is not so interesting for some human, but it is important to help us grow. Now, here is a little trick for people finding it extremely hard to finish a book, pick a theme to read on and  select at least two to three books on that theme, *for instance, your theme is how to build self esteem, you can go with the power of positive thinking by Norman Vincent Peale, OR Awaken the Giant within by Tony Robbins* when you have your books ready, start with one, and set a deadline for yourself. You can go with five pages per day or one chapter per day. Just put your mind to it. This helps one read more and make the book have a lasting impact in us. 

  **TAKE PROFESSIONAL COURSES**

This period is the perfect time to groom yourself professionally. While staying at home, you can try to learn a skill or improve yours if you have one already. More so, professional websites are giving back during this period, so majority of them are offering professional courses at no charge. some even comes with a certificate, so  take advantage of it! Just register, pick a course that interests you, and stay dedicated to it. All it cost is data connection and listening years, be dedicated too. Here is a list of website offering free courses to help you-

  **CHECK UP ON FRIENDS**

As much as this lock down gives us enough time, it is causing a havoc in the minds of many. Especially for folks struggling mentally and financially. I have personally been taking this period to reach out to my old friends, and this has helped me a lot.   That call can help somebody smile, and help them know that somebody cares. More so, it  can further helps to strengthen or build that bond you you with loved ones, family and friends. So make that call, now!  

   **UPDATE YOUR LINKEDIN PROFILE**

Every professional individual should have a LinkedIn account, if you do not have one, please create! it is a great place to network and build professional connection with potential client and employees. This is the perfect time to  build your portfolio, add your experiences, skills, licenses and certification, endorsement, Just update your profile, make it look  attractive yet very professional Also connect with mentors and important figures. This gives us exposure which could be a great boost to your career.

   **HAVE A DAILY WORKOUT ROUTINE**

   **TRY A NEW RECIPE**

Cooking is another skill every person should have, if you want to survive. Plus, it is a really interesting and fun thing to do (for some people). Personally, i love cooking, and quaratine has helped me revive this vibe, as i have been trying out new dishes and soups. This period should be a time to try out new things to, bake, cook, fry or do a switch up on your normal food-making technique. This is fun, trust me. Just enjoy it.

   **DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT**

Well the best for the last, right.. GET SOMETHING DONE. A perfect time to Get that hidden talent out! you have all that time now. Do something fun with your time, sing karaoke, paint your room, make a dress, dye your hair, do yoga, sing a solo, take pictures, edit them, ... Just do something really exiting.

Okay a challenge, try the first exiting thing that comes to your mind while reading this. do not forget to take a picture. it's not cliche, it's just a switch up, duh.
