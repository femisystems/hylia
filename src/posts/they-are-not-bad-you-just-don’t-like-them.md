Most times in life, when we can not do something because of the societal values we have the placed on, or because of our upbringing, we tend to see others who do them in such a bad. The truth is some of these things we long to do them- maybe just for experience, but because we can not, and so see these other ones as the devil’s incarnate.

For a fact, as parent, i think while bringing up a child it is fair to always teach them not to judge based off a premise- That is only the standpoint that can help in raising better teens and youths. It helps them see everyone as one; even if it’s hard. 

Personally, I remember growing up to see the muslims as bad because they do not believe in Jesus and my own God- this was taught everywhere i am. In my family house(even with the fact that my mum has an islamic linage) in my church- it was worse! In fact, they even made us see some other christians who do not worship according to their doctrine as enemies of Christ, Then my secondary school fellowship, always making references to light shall not work with darkness.

Now, is this what christ teaches us? According to leviticus 19:18 Christ teaches us to love all. Because we are of one body! We are made by the same Being, we only worship differently and this doesn’t make our own way of worship the only recognized one in the Kingdom. 

In fact, this happens with our parents most times, they still want to be the one who controls every single thing you do, forgetting that things no longer work the way it did while they were our age. They still want us to dance to their tune - which is not bad, but i also feel they should often times, listen to where we are coming from and what we aim to achieve- experience doesn’t always do it. 

Having said this, The fact that others do not things in your exact same manner and way doesn’t make them bad. As long as they do not hurt others and do it with a pure mind, it only means they’re being human. I honestly wish people will judge less and listen more, maybe we would have a saner society, just maybe!
